Purpose:	To extract the neighborhood of an AMR gene from an assembly graph

To run:
- The Bandage+BLAST implementation:
	python extract_neighborhood.py --amr/-A <AMR gene file path in FASTA format>
	--gfa/-G <GFA assembly graph>
	--length/-L <length of the linear sequence around AMR gene to be extracted (default = 1000)>
