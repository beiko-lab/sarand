Purpose:	To extract the neighborhood of an AMR gene from an assembly graph,
            annotate it and compare with the reference genome(s)

To run:
    python full_pipeline.py

NOTE: all parameters can be set in params.py
NOTE: if use_RGI = TRUE, make sure either RGI has been installed system-wide or
    you already are in the environment RGI installed in!
